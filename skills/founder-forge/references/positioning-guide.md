# Positioning & USPs — Artifact Guide

## Purpose

Positioning answers one question: "In a world full of alternatives, why should YOUR ideal customer choose YOU?"

Great positioning is specific, defensible, and resonant with the target customer. It's not a tagline — it's a strategic claim that guides every marketing and sales decision. When done right, it makes the choice feel obvious.

## Document Structure

### 1. Market Context Summary

A brief (1-2 paragraph) summary of the competitive landscape as it applies to this business:
- Who are the primary competitors / alternatives?
- What do they claim? (Summarize the crowded positioning territory)
- What positioning angles are underexplored?

This sets the context for why the chosen positioning is the right move.

### 2. Positioning Statement

The classic Geoffrey Moore positioning statement template — one tight paragraph:

> **For** [target customer], **who** [have a specific need or situation], **[company/product name]** is a [market category] **that** [delivers a specific benefit]. **Unlike** [primary alternative or competitor], **we** [key differentiator].

**Writing a strong positioning statement:**
- The "target customer" should match the ICP exactly
- The "specific need or situation" is the trigger moment or core pain point
- The "market category" tells them how to think about you (avoids confusion)
- The "specific benefit" is the outcome they care about, not the feature you have
- The "key differentiator" should be something true, specific, and hard to copy

**Example (illustrative — not to use verbatim):**
> For operations leaders at Series A SaaS companies who waste 20+ hours per month manually reconciling data across tools, DataSync is a no-code integration platform that eliminates manual ops work in 72 hours. Unlike Zapier or custom development, we offer pre-built SaaS-to-SaaS connectors that require zero engineering resources.

### 3. Alternative Positioning Statements

Provide 2 alternative versions that take different angles (e.g., emphasizing a different benefit, a different competitor contrast, or a different customer segment). This gives the founder options to test.

---

### 4. Unique Selling Propositions (USPs)

Identify 3-5 genuine differentiators. For each USP:

**USP Name**: (a short, memorable label)
**The Claim**: (the specific thing you do or offer)
**Why It Matters**: (what the customer gains — tied to their pain points from the ICP)
**Why It's Defensible**: (why competitors can't easily copy this — is it a process, credential, network, technology, team, guarantee?)
**Evidence / Proof**: (how you'd demonstrate or substantiate this claim)

**USP quality standards:**
- Specific: "We reduce onboarding time by 60%" not "We're fast"
- Verifiable: There's a way to prove or demonstrate it
- Relevant: The ICP explicitly cares about this
- Differentiated: Competitors don't already claim it (or can't do it as well)

**Examples of weak vs strong USPs:**
- Weak: "We're experienced and reliable"
- Strong: "100% of projects delivered on time in 47 completed engagements — guaranteed by contract"

- Weak: "We use a proven methodology"
- Strong: "Our 3-week Clarity Sprint™ is built on 200+ brand strategy projects across 12 industries — documented, repeatable, teachable"

### 5. Competitive Positioning Matrix

A visual map of the competitive landscape showing where this business sits relative to competitors on 2 key dimensions.

Choose the 2 dimensions that matter most to the ICP. Common pairs:
- Price vs. Specialization
- DIY vs. Done-for-You
- Speed vs. Depth
- Tech-Forward vs. Relationship-Forward
- Niche vs. Generalist

| | **[Low X axis]** | **[High X axis]** |
|---|---|---|
| **[High Y axis]** | Competitor A | **[Our Company]** |
| **[Low Y axis]** | Competitor B, C | Competitor D |

Include 1-2 sentences explaining why this positioning in the matrix is the right territory.

---

### 6. Category Design

Should this business fit into an existing market category — or create a new one?

- **Existing category**: Faster to educate buyers, but harder to differentiate. Use when the category is well-understood and the business clearly wins within it.
- **New category**: Harder to educate, but can own the space. Use when existing categories don't capture the value, or when competitors' framing works against the business.

Recommendation: (pick one, explain why)

If creating a new category, provide:
- The new category name
- The old category it replaces or escapes from
- The one-sentence explanation of why the old category was limiting

---

### 7. Positioning Tests

Run the positioning through these 3 tests before finalizing:

**The "So What?" Test**
Read the positioning statement aloud. After each sentence, ask: "So what?" If there's no clear answer that connects to customer value, rewrite.

**The "Only We" Test**
Can you say "Only [company name] [differentiator]"? If not, the positioning is too generic.
- "Only DataSync offers pre-built SaaS connectors with zero engineering dependency" ✓
- "Only DataSync offers excellent customer service" ✗

**The Customer Mirror Test**
Would the ICP read this positioning and immediately think "this is for me"? Or would they read it and think "this could be for anyone"?
Show the positioning statement to 3 people who match the ICP description (or simulate their reaction based on your ICP research). Note their response.

---

### 8. Messaging Implications

How does this positioning translate into practical messaging rules?

- **The headline formula**: [Specific benefit] for [Specific customer] — what's the 8-10 word version of this positioning?
- **What to lead with**: Which USP should anchor all outbound communication?
- **What to avoid saying**: What claims or language would undermine or muddy this position?
- **The competitive contrast**: When prospects compare, what's the one-sentence answer to "why not [main competitor]?"

## Success Criteria

The Positioning artifact is complete when:
- [ ] The positioning statement passes all 3 tests (So What, Only We, Customer Mirror)
- [ ] Each USP is specific, verifiable, and genuinely differentiated
- [ ] The competitive matrix shows a clear, defensible position
- [ ] A salesperson could use this to answer "why should I choose you?" in 30 seconds
- [ ] The messaging implications section gives clear do's and don'ts
- [ ] The positioning is clearly informed by and consistent with the ICP artifact
