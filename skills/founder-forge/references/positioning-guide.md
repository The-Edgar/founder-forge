# Positioning & USPs — Artifact Guide

## Purpose

Positioning answers one question: "In a world full of alternatives, why should YOUR ideal customer choose YOU?"

Great positioning is specific, defensible, and resonant with the target customer. It's not a tagline — it's a strategic claim that guides every marketing and sales decision. When done right, it makes the choice feel obvious.

## Document Structure

### 1. Market Context Summary

One short paragraph summarizing the competitive landscape:
- Who are the primary competitors / alternatives?
- What territory do they all cluster around?
- What positioning angle is underexplored?

Write this as a setup for the positioning statement, not as a standalone analysis.

### 2. Positioning Statement

One positioning statement using the Geoffrey Moore template:

> **For** [target customer], **who** [have a specific need or situation], **[company/product name]** is a [market category] **that** [delivers a specific benefit]. **Unlike** [primary alternative or competitor], **we** [key differentiator].

Write one statement. Do not write alternative versions.

**Standards for a strong statement:**
- "Target customer" matches the ICP exactly
- "Market category" tells buyers how to think about the business (avoids confusion)
- "Specific benefit" is the outcome the customer cares about, not the feature
- "Key differentiator" is true, specific, and hard to copy

Apply the So What / Only We tests as an internal drafting check before writing the final statement:
- **So What test**: After each clause, the customer benefit should be obvious. If it isn't, rewrite.
- **Only We test**: Can you say "Only [company] [differentiator]"? If not, make it more specific.

These tests are drafting tools. Do not include a "Positioning Tests" section in the output.

### 3. Unique Selling Propositions (USPs)

Write exactly **3 USPs**. For each, write one paragraph (3-4 sentences) that combines:
- The specific differentiator
- Why it's defensible (process, credential, network, tech, guarantee)
- The proof point or evidence

Do not use a sub-section structure (Claim / Why Different / Why Defensible / Evidence). Write the paragraph so these elements flow naturally.

**USP quality standards:**
- Specific: "We reduce onboarding time by 60%" not "We're fast"
- Verifiable: There's a way to prove or demonstrate it
- Relevant: The ICP explicitly cares about this (refer to pain points from the ICP doc)
- Differentiated: Competitors don't already claim it equally well

### 4. Competitive Positioning Matrix

Write the table. No explanatory paragraphs before or after it — the table shows the position; that's enough.

Choose the 2 dimensions that matter most to the ICP. Common pairs:
- Price vs. Specialization
- DIY vs. Done-for-You
- Speed vs. Depth
- Tech-Forward vs. Relationship-Forward

| | **[Low X axis]** | **[High X axis]** |
|---|---|---|
| **[High Y axis]** | Competitor A | **[Our Company]** |
| **[Low Y axis]** | Competitor B, C | Competitor D |

### 5. Messaging Implications

Four direct statements — no sub-sections:

1. **Lead with**: Which USP should anchor all outbound communication
2. **Headline formula**: The 8-10 word version of this positioning (benefit + customer)
3. **Avoid saying**: Claims or language that would muddy this position
4. **Competitive contrast**: One sentence to answer "why not [main competitor]?"
