# Service Offerings & Pricing — Artifact Guide

## Purpose

Most founders either underprice (charging for hours, not value) or overcomplicate (too many options, too many variables). This artifact designs a clean, confidence-inspiring service structure with pricing grounded in market benchmarks and value delivered — not hours worked.

## Document Structure

### 1. Offering Philosophy

Write one short paragraph covering:
- How this business thinks about value (outcome-based, transformation-based, etc.)
- Minimum engagement that makes sense financially and quality-wise
- Pricing transparency approach: public, "contact us," or range — and why that fits this ICP

One paragraph. Not two.

---

### 2. Service Tier Architecture

Design 2-4 tiers. 3 is optimal (anchoring effect: buyers gravitate to the middle).

For each tier:

**[Tier Name]** — (clear, benefit-oriented — not Bronze/Silver/Gold)

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Who it's for** | Specific sub-segment of the ICP |
| **The promise** | What outcome do they walk away with? |
| **What's included** | Specific deliverables, sessions, access, timeline |
| **Price** | Clear price or range |
| **Commitment** | One-time, monthly, annual, project-based |

**Tier naming principles:**
- Name tiers after outcomes or customer states, not internal categories
- Examples: "Foundation / Scale / Partner" (agency), "Sprint / System / Full-Build" (consultancy)
- Names should feel like the customer chose the right level, not like they picked a package

---

### 3. Pricing Strategy & Rationale

Write as 3 direct statements:

1. **Market position**: Where this pricing lands relative to competitors (lower/middle/premium) and why that's the right signal for this ICP
2. **Pricing model**: Why this specific model (retainer / project / value-based / per-seat) fits what the ICP prefers and creates alignment between delivery and outcomes
3. **Tier logic**: Which tier is the anchor (makes the middle feel reasonable), which is designed to convert most buyers, and which is the entry option

---

### 4. Pricing Psychology in Practice

Apply pricing psychology directly to the pricing language and structure. Do not define or explain anchoring, decoy effect, or loss aversion — show the application.

- Frame the investment before stating the price: "For [outcome], the investment is $X" — not "$X/month"
- Place the primary tier's price adjacent to the anchor tier so the comparison does the work
- For 3-tier structures, make the middle tier's value dramatically better than the entry tier's — the contrast should be obvious without explanation
- Include one loss-framing statement on the pricing page: what the ICP loses by not investing

---

### 5. The Offer Stack

For the primary tier, write the complete value breakdown in one table:

**[Tier Name] — What's Included**

| What You Get | Value | Why It Matters |
|-------------|-------|----------------|
| [Deliverable 1] | $X | [1 sentence — why it matters to this ICP] |
| [Deliverable 2] | $X | |
| [Deliverable 3] | $X | |
| [Bonus/Add-on] | $X | |
| **Total Value** | **$X,XXX** | |
| **Your Investment** | **$X,XXX** | |

Write this table once. Do not reproduce it in the Pricing Language section, in the Website Messaging doc, or anywhere else.

---

### 6. Add-Ons & Upsells

One short table:

| Add-On | What It Is | Price | Best For |
|--------|-----------|-------|---------|
| [Name] | [Description] | $X | [Who] |

---

### 7. Revenue Model Snapshot

Three headline ARR scenarios, each with the single key assumption it rests on:

| Scenario | Clients | Revenue/Client | Monthly Revenue | Key Assumption |
|----------|---------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Early (Month 3) | X | $X | $X,XXX | [One assumption] |
| Growth (Month 12) | X | $X | $X,XXX | [One assumption] |
| Target | X | $X | $X,XXX | [One assumption] |

Do not write a client-by-client breakdown. The table above is enough to validate whether the model is viable.

---

### 8. Pricing Language

How to talk about price — 5 bullets, no sub-sections:

- When to introduce pricing in a sales conversation (what must happen first)
- How to frame the investment: the exact sentence structure to use
- One-sentence answer to the "it's too expensive" objection
- One-sentence answer to the "I need to think about it" objection
- One-sentence answer to the most common price-related objection specific to this business's ICP

Do not include a full proposal sample. Proposal templates belong in a separate sales asset, not in the Pricing doc.

## Connecting to Other Artifacts

- **ICP doc**: Price points must be within reach of the target customer's budget
- **Positioning doc**: Pricing must support the positioning claim — premium positioning needs premium or mid-premium pricing
- **Brand Voice doc**: How pricing is described should match the brand's tone
- **Website Messaging doc**: The pricing section of the website draws from this artifact — reference it, don't reproduce it

## Success Criteria

The Pricing artifact is complete when:
- [ ] Each tier has a specific, benefit-oriented name
- [ ] Price points are grounded in market benchmarks from the research phase
- [ ] The offer stack appears once in the document
- [ ] The revenue model shows whether the model is viable at target scale — 3 scenarios, one key assumption each
- [ ] The pricing model is justified in terms of the ICP's preferences and business sustainability
- [ ] Pricing language gives 5 usable bullets — no full proposal sample
