# Service Offerings & Pricing — Artifact Guide

## Purpose

Most founders either underprice (charging for hours, not value) or overcomplicate (too many options, too many variables). This artifact designs a clean, confidence-inspiring service structure with pricing that's grounded in market benchmarks and value delivered — not hours worked.

The output is a complete offering architecture: the tiers, the names, the inclusions, the price points, and the framing that makes buyers feel the value before seeing the price tag.

## Document Structure

### 1. Offering Philosophy

A short (1-2 paragraph) statement of the business's approach to packaging and pricing:
- How does this business think about value? (outcome-based, time-based, transformation-based?)
- What's the minimum engagement that makes sense — financially and quality-wise?
- What's the philosophy on transparency: public pricing, "contact us," or a range?
- Why this approach fits this ICP (connect to the ICP artifact)

---

### 2. Service Tier Architecture

Design 2-4 service tiers. 3 is typically optimal (anchoring effect: buyers gravitate to the middle).

For each tier, define:

**Tier Name**: (Clear, benefit-oriented — not "Bronze/Silver/Gold" or "Starter/Pro/Enterprise" unless it fits)

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Who it's for** | Specific sub-segment of the ICP |
| **The promise** | What outcome do they walk away with? |
| **What's included** | Specific deliverables, sessions, access, timeline |
| **Price** | Clear price or range |
| **Commitment** | One-time, monthly, annual, project-based |
| **Ideal outcome** | What does success look like for this buyer? |

**Tier naming principles:**
- Name tiers after outcomes or customer states, not your internal categories
- Examples: "Foundation / Scale / Partner" (agency), "Essentials / Growth / Enterprise" (SaaS), "Sprint / System / Full-Build" (consultancy)
- Avoid generic names that feel like they were borrowed from a template

---

### 3. Pricing Strategy & Rationale

**Market benchmark context:**
- What is the price range in this market? (Use research from the competitor analysis)
- Where does this business's pricing fall relative to competitors? (lower, middle, premium)
- Why is that the right position? (quality signals, speed, access, risk reduction)

**Pricing model justification:**
Why this specific pricing model (retainer / project / value-based / per-seat / etc.)?
- What does the ICP prefer? (Based on ICP research and questions)
- What creates the best alignment between delivery and client outcomes?
- What model lets the business grow without trading solely hours for dollars?

**Anchoring strategy:**
- Which tier is the "anchor" (highest price that makes the middle feel reasonable)?
- Which tier is designed to convert most buyers?
- Which tier is the entry/trial option?

---

### 4. Pricing Psychology Applications

Document specific techniques being used, with the rationale:

**Anchoring**: The premium tier ($X,XXX) makes the core tier ($X,XXX) feel like a deal. Lead with the anchor on the pricing page.

**Value framing**: Before stating the price, frame the value. "For [outcome], the investment is $X" — never just "$X/month."

**Decoy effect** (if using 3 tiers): The middle tier should offer dramatically better value than the entry tier, making it the obvious choice.

**Loss aversion**: What do buyers lose by NOT investing? ("Without a clear ICP, you'll keep attracting wrong-fit clients that drain your team.")

**Social proof adjacency**: Price reveals best alongside testimonials or case study results — "clients using this tier average $X in new revenue within 90 days."

---

### 5. The Offer Stack

For the primary tier (the one most buyers should choose), build out a complete offer stack — everything that comes with it, presented in terms of value:

**[Tier Name] — The Complete Picture**

| What You Get | What It's Worth | Why It Matters |
|-------------|-----------------|----------------|
| [Deliverable 1] | $X value | [1 sentence on why this matters to ICP] |
| [Deliverable 2] | $X value | |
| [Deliverable 3] | $X value | |
| [Bonus/Add-on] | $X value | |
| **Total Value** | **$X,XXX** | |
| **Your Investment** | **$X,XXX** | |

This format helps buyers feel the value before seeing the price.

---

### 6. Add-Ons & Upsells

Define 2-3 add-on services or upgrade options that can expand deal size or extend the relationship:

| Add-On | What It Is | Price | Best For |
|--------|-----------|-------|---------|
| [Name] | [Description] | $X | [Who benefits] |

---

### 7. Pricing Presentation Guidance

**On the website**: Recommendation on how to display pricing (show all tiers, show range, show entry point only, "contact us for pricing"). Include the rationale based on the ICP's buying behavior.

**In proposals**: How to present pricing in a written proposal — after value articulation, framed as investment, with the offer stack breakdown.

**In sales conversations**: At what point in the conversation to introduce pricing, and how to frame it ("The investment for [tier] is $X, which typically pays for itself when...")

**Handling price objections**: 2-3 specific responses to the most common pricing objections for this business (identified in ICP objections section).

---

### 8. Revenue Model Snapshot

A simple view of what the business could earn at different scales:

| Scenario | # Clients | Revenue/Client | Monthly Revenue |
|----------|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| Early (Month 3) | X | $X | $X,XXX |
| Growth (Month 12) | X | $X | $X,XXX |
| Target | X | $X | $X,XXX |

This grounds the pricing in business reality and helps the founder see whether the model is viable.

## Connecting to Other Artifacts

The Pricing artifact must be consistent with:
- **ICP**: Price points must be within reach of the target customer's budget (use firmographic data)
- **Positioning**: Pricing must support the positioning claim (premium positioning requires premium or mid-premium pricing)
- **Brand Voice**: How pricing is described should match the brand's tone — a direct brand presents pricing directly, a warm brand frames it warmly
- **Website Messaging Map**: The pricing section of the website will draw directly from this artifact

## Success Criteria

The Pricing artifact is complete when:
- [ ] Each tier has a specific, benefit-oriented name (not generic placeholders)
- [ ] Price points are grounded in market benchmarks from the research phase
- [ ] The offer stack makes the value tangible before revealing the price
- [ ] The pricing model is justified in terms of the ICP's preferences and business sustainability
- [ ] The revenue model snapshot shows whether the model is viable at target scale
- [ ] A founder could hand this to a designer and have a pricing page built from it
- [ ] Price objections have specific, prepared responses
