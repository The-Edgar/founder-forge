# Strategic Clarification Questions Framework

This framework guides the strategic clarification phase. Use it to identify gaps in the founder's initial description and ask targeted questions that produce the specific, actionable answers needed for artifact generation.

**Goal**: After this phase, you should have enough detail to write a Business Context Summary (200-300 words) that can fully inform all 6 artifacts — without needing to ask the user for more information again.

## The 6 Question Categories

### Category 1: Target Customer Precision

You need a specific enough customer description to write a real ICP — not "SMB owners" but "COOs at 50-200 person B2B SaaS companies with $5-20M ARR who own the vendor/tooling budget."

**Ask about:**
- Revenue range and company size (for B2B) OR age range, income, lifestyle markers (for B2C)
- Industry verticals they're targeting — is this industry-specific or industry-agnostic?
- Geographic focus — local, regional, national, global?
- Tech sophistication — are these early adopters, pragmatists, or laggards?
- Specific platforms, tools, or channels they use (this reveals where to reach them)
- Decision-maker vs. influencer vs. end user — who actually buys vs. who uses vs. who approves?

**Good question examples:**
- "Who specifically pays you? What's their job title, and what's their typical company size?"
- "Is this for a specific industry, or anyone who [does X]?"
- "Are your buyers tech-savvy early adopters or more conservative buyers who need hand-holding?"

### Category 2: Differentiation & Competitive Edge

You need to know what actually makes them different — not what they hope makes them different. The best differentiators are specific, verifiable, and hard to copy.

**Ask about:**
- What can they do that competitors genuinely cannot? (capability, speed, price, access, methodology)
- Do they have any proprietary methodology, process, IP, or technology?
- Team background: relevant credentials, industry experience, previous successes?
- Network advantages: access to distribution, partnerships, communities, or relationships?
- What would a customer say when recommending them to a peer?

**Good question examples:**
- "If I asked your best customer to tell a friend why they chose you over [competitor], what would they say?"
- "What do you do differently in how you deliver results — your actual process or methodology?"
- "What credibility signals do you have? (Credentials, past employers, notable clients, case studies)"

---

### Category 3: Brand Personality & Voice

You need 3-4 concrete personality traits with clear "this, not that" definitions — specific enough to use as guardrails for all written communication.

**Ask about:**
- How do they want to come across? 3-4 adjectives that describe the ideal brand personality
- What they're explicitly NOT — this is often more clarifying than what they are
- Tone on the spectrum: formal ↔ casual, serious ↔ playful, technical ↔ accessible
- A brand or person they admire (and why) — this reveals a lot about aspirational voice
- Examples of communication they hate seeing in their industry

**Good question examples:**
- "Give me 3-4 words that describe how you want to sound to your customers."
- "What kind of [industry] communication do you hate? What feels wrong or off-putting?"
- "Is there a company or person in any industry whose voice/brand you admire? What do you like about it?"

---

### Category 4: Pricing & Service Philosophy

You need enough to construct a pricing tier structure — what you sell, how you package it, and at what price points.

**Ask about:**
- Primary pricing model: project-based, monthly retainer, value-based, per-seat, percentage, hybrid?
- Approximate price ranges or "starting at" amounts (even rough estimates are fine)
- Minimum engagement size — what's the smallest deal they'll take?
- Pricing transparency on website: show prices publicly, "contact us," or a range?
- What outcomes/results do customers pay for? (This reveals value-based pricing anchors)

**Good question examples:**
- "How do you typically charge? Per project, monthly retainer, or something else?"
- "What's your current or target price range for a typical engagement?"
- "What's the minimum deal size worth your time?"
- "Are you comfortable showing prices publicly, or do you prefer 'contact for pricing'?"

---

### Category 5: Proof & Credibility

You need to know what trust signals exist NOW — not what they plan to build. Empty placeholder content destroys conversions.

**Ask about:**
- Existing case studies or project outcomes (even 1-2 wins that can be turned into stories)
- Testimonials or quotes from past clients (even informal ones)
- Founder/team credentials: notable employers, education, certifications, industry recognition
- Partnerships, technology integrations, or certifications that add credibility
- Any media mentions, speaking, or community reputation

**Good question examples:**
- "Do you have any wins or results from past work that could become case studies, even rough ones?"
- "What credentials or background do you or your team have that your target customer would find impressive?"
- "Any quotes or feedback from past clients we could use as social proof?"

---

### Category 6: Capacity & Scope

You need to understand what they can actually deliver — this prevents positioning promises they can't keep and helps define service scope clearly.

**Ask about:**
- Team size and structure (solo, small team, growing?)
- Primary tools and platforms they work with or specialize in
- Explicit exclusions — what they don't do, won't do, or should be clear they don't offer
- Bandwidth constraints that affect how they can scale or what they can take on
- Geographic or timezone constraints that affect delivery

**Good question examples:**
- "Are you solo or do you have a team? How big?"
- "What tools or platforms do you primarily work in or specialize with?"
- "What do you explicitly NOT offer? What should be clear you don't do?"

## Adaptation Guidelines

### B2B vs B2C
- **B2B**: Emphasize firmographics (company size, revenue, industry), decision-maker hierarchy, procurement process, ROI expectations
- **B2C**: Emphasize demographics, lifestyle, emotional motivators, community/social proof, individual pain points

### Service vs Product
- **Service**: Focus on process, delivery quality, expertise, relationships, outcomes
- **Product**: Focus on features, integrations, scalability, user experience, pricing tiers

### Early-stage vs Established
- **Early-stage**: Acknowledge limited proof points, focus on founder credibility and vision, be realistic about case studies
- **Established**: Mine for specific outcomes, testimonials, and proof points that should anchor every artifact

## Question Quality Standards

**Good questions are:**
- Specific enough that vague answers reveal a problem (and you can follow up)
- Informed by research — don't ask things the market research already told you
- Connected to artifact needs — every answer should directly feed into at least one artifact
- Decision-forcing — they help the founder make choices, not just describe preferences

**Avoid:**
- Generic questions like "Who is your target customer?" without specifics
- Double-barrel questions (ask one thing at a time)
- Questions that can be answered with "yes" (unless you want binary clarity)
- Questions the user already answered in their initial description
