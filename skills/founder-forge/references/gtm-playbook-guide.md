# GTM Playbook — Artifact Guide

## Purpose

The GTM Playbook is the bridge between strategy and execution. By this point, the founder knows who they're targeting, how they're positioned, what their voice sounds like, and what they're selling. This answers: **How do you reach them, and what do you say?**

This is built around **1-2 channels the founder selects**. A focused playbook for 2 channels beats a superficial playbook for 6.

**Critical**: Every channel section MUST include **4-5 specific, ready-to-use hooks** grounded in real research.

---

## Pre-Build Checklist

Before generating this artifact, confirm:
- [ ] Which 1-2 channels the founder selected
- [ ] All prior artifacts are read (ICP doc, Positioning doc, Brand Voice doc, Pricing doc are all inputs)
- [ ] Web searches have been done on: what's currently working on each channel in this niche, trending hook formats, top-performing content in the target industry

---

## Document Structure

### 1. Channel Selection Rationale

For each chosen channel, write exactly **3 bullets**:
1. Why this channel fits this ICP (where they actually spend time, based on ICP research)
2. Realistic 90-day metric range (e.g., "15-30 qualified conversations", "500-1,500 profile views/week")
3. One risk or challenge to be aware of

Do not write explanatory paragraphs about why a channel is generally good for B2B or any category. State the ICP fit, the number, and the risk — that's enough.

### 2. [CHANNEL 1] Playbook

Build a complete playbook for the first chosen channel. Use the relevant template below.

## Channel Playbook Templates

### Cold Email Playbook

**Research first**: Search for "[target industry] cold email examples 2024", "cold email subject lines that get replies [niche]", "cold email open rates benchmarks" before writing this section.

#### Sequence Architecture

| Email | Timing | Goal | Focus |
|-------|--------|------|-------|
| Email 1 | Day 0 | Intro + one value point | Pattern interrupt / specificity |
| Email 2 | Day 3-4 | Different angle | Social proof or case study |
| Email 3 | Day 7-8 | Soft close | Direct ask or resource |
| Email 4 | Day 14 | Break-up | Transparency / humor |

#### Personalization Framework

2-3 specific signals to research on each prospect before emailing, and how to reference each naturally in the opening line.

#### HOOKS — Cold Email Subject Lines

**MANDATORY**: Search for trending cold email subject lines in this specific niche before writing. Each hook must be grounded in what's actually working.

Generate **4-5 specific subject lines** for this business. For each:

```
Subject Line: "[Exact subject line text]"
Why it works: [One-line psychological note — pattern interrupt / curiosity gap / specificity / social proof]
```

Do not include a scroll-stop score. Do not include "How to adapt it" blocks.

Hook formats to draw from:
- **Pattern interrupt**: Completely unexpected for this industry ("I don't want to sell you anything")
- **Specificity**: Name a specific company, person, or result ("[Their company]'s approach to [X]")
- **Curiosity gap**: Incomplete information that forces the open ("The reason [ICP pain point] keeps happening")
- **Social proof**: Name a recognizable client or result ("[Known company] did this in 30 days")
- **Direct**: No games, just the offer ("15-minute call to show you [specific outcome]?")

#### Email Body Framework

Opening line formulas (write one example of each for this specific business):
- Hyper-specific: "[I saw you just] / [I noticed that] / [Congrats on]" + relevant signal
- Result-first: "[Client type] achieved [result] in [timeframe]."

Body structure (2-3 sentences): why them specifically → what you do + one specific result → the ask (tiny commitment)
