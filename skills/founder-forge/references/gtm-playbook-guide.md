# GTM Playbook — Artifact Guide

## Purpose

The GTM Playbook is the bridge between strategy and execution. By this point, the founder knows who they're targeting, how they're positioned, what their voice sounds like, and what they're selling. The GTM Playbook answers: **How do you reach them, and what do you say?**

This is the most channel-specific artifact. It's built around **1-2 channels the founder selects** — not a generic outreach guide. A focused playbook for 2 channels beats a superficial playbook for 6.

**Critical**: Every channel section MUST include **4-5 specific, ready-to-use hooks** grounded in real research. These are the most immediately actionable elements of the entire artifact.

---

## Pre-Build Checklist

Before generating this artifact, confirm:
- [ ] Which 1-2 channels the founder selected
- [ ] All prior artifacts are read (ICP, Positioning, Brand Voice, Pricing are all inputs)
- [ ] Web searches have been done on: what's currently working on each channel in this niche, trending hook formats, top-performing content in the target industry

---

**Research first**: Search for "[target industry] cold email examples 2024", "cold email subject lines that get replies [niche]", "cold email open rates benchmarks" before writing this section.

#### Sequence Architecture

Design a 3-5 email sequence:

| Email | Timing | Goal | Subject Line Focus |
|-------|--------|------|-------------------|
| Email 1 | Day 0 | Intro + one value point | Pattern interrupt / specificity |
| Email 2 | Day 3-4 | Follow up with different angle | Social proof or case study |
| Email 3 | Day 7-8 | Soft close / ask | Direct ask or resource |
| Email 4 | Day 14 | Break-up email | Transparency / humor |

#### Personalization Framework

What to research on each prospect before emailing:
- [2-3 specific personalization signals to look for]
- How to reference it naturally in the opening line

#### HOOKS — Cold Email Subject Lines

**MANDATORY**: Perform a web search for trending cold email subject lines and open rate benchmarks in this specific niche before writing these. Each hook must be grounded in what's actually working.

Subject line hook formats to draw from:
- **Pattern interrupt**: Completely unexpected subject line for this industry ("I don't want to sell you anything")
- **Specificity**: Name a specific company, person, or result ("[Their company name]'s approach to [X]")
- **Curiosity gap**: Incomplete information that forces the open ("The reason [ICP pain point] keeps happening")
- **Social proof**: Name a recognizable client or result ("[Known company] did this in 30 days")
- **Direct**: No games, just the offer ("15-minute call to show you [specific outcome]?")

#### Email Body Framework

Opening line formulas that get responses:
- Hyper-specific opener: "[I saw you just] / [I noticed that] / [Congrats on]" + relevant signal
- Shared context opener: "[We both work with] / [I've helped companies like]" + bridge
- Result-first opener: "[Client type] achieved [result] in [timeframe]. Here's how."

Body structure (2-3 sentences max):
1. Why they specifically (not generic)
2. What you do + one specific result
3. The ask (tiny commitment — 15 minutes, a reply, a yes/no)

## 3. Multi-Channel Integration (If 2 Channels Selected)

- TikTok (top-of-funnel awareness) → Website/email capture → Email nurture → Conversion

Design the specific integration flow for the chosen channels:
- What does success on [Channel 1] unlock for [Channel 2]?
