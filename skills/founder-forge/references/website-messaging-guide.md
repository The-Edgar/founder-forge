# Website Messaging Map — Artifact Guide

## Purpose

The Website Messaging Map takes everything built so far — the ICP, positioning, brand voice, and pricing — and turns it into specific copy frameworks for each page of the website.

This is a messaging architecture: what to say, in what order, with what goal, on every key page. A designer or developer can build directly from this document.

## Document Structure

### 1. Messaging Strategy Overview

Two short paragraphs:
1. The website's primary job: generate leads, build credibility, drive demo bookings, sell directly? What buying stage does it primarily serve?
2. The primary CTA — label, destination, and why this action fits this ICP's buying behavior.

---

### 2. Homepage Messaging Map

The homepage must answer 3 questions in the first 5 seconds: What is this? Who is it for? Why should I care?

#### Hero Section

**Headline**: Write one headline (8-12 words) that states the primary benefit for the ICP.

If listing options, write them plain — one per line, no sub-sections, no rationale explaining why each works:

> Option A: [headline]
> Option B: [headline]
> Option C: [headline]

Formula options:
- **Benefit-first**: "[Specific Outcome] for [Specific Customer]"
- **Problem-first**: "Stop [Specific Frustration]. Start [Specific Outcome]."
- **Only we**: "The only [category] that [unique differentiator] for [customer]"

**Subheadline**: 1-2 sentences (20-30 words) adding specificity — who it's for, how it works, what makes it different.

**Hero CTA**:
- Primary: [Label] — action-oriented, specific
- Secondary: [Label] — lower commitment (e.g., "See how it works")

**Hero proof note**: What sits next to or below the hero copy? (client logos, a result stat, a product screenshot)

---

#### Problem Statement Section

This is where buyers feel seen. Articulate the problem before introducing the solution.

- **Section headline**: frames the problem without sounding negative
- **Body**: 3-4 bullets describing the situation the ICP is in, the frustrations they're experiencing, and the cost of the status quo. Use language pulled directly from the ICP doc's pain points section.

---

#### Solution Overview Section

Bridge from problem to solution.

- **Section headline**: introduces the solution category and primary benefit
- **Body**: 2-3 bullets covering what this solution does (high level), how it works briefly, and the transformation: before → after

---

#### Key Benefits / How It Works Section

3-4 benefits or steps. For each:
- **Label**: one-word or short descriptor
- **Headline**: the benefit or step in 5-8 words
- **Body**: 1-3 sentences of supporting detail

---

#### Social Proof Section

**If testimonials exist:**
- 2-3 testimonials from the ICP's peer group
- Format: Quote + Name + Title/Company

**If case studies exist:**
- Headline: "[Client type] achieved [specific result] in [timeframe]"
- 2-3 sentence summary of the outcome

**If no testimonials yet:**
- Specific outcome claims backed by the founder's credentials
- Credibility signals: notable past employers, certifications, partnerships

---

#### Final CTA Section

- **Section headline**: addresses the final objection before they leave (risk or timing)
- **Body**: 1-2 sentences that reduce friction
- **CTA button**: same label as hero, or a slightly different angle

---

### 3. About Page Messaging Map

**Origin story** (2-4 paragraphs):
- Why this business exists
- The problem personally experienced or witnessed
- The moment they decided to build this solution
- What makes them the right people to build it

**Team section**: for each key person — name, title, 2-3 sentence bio with specific credibility ("Previously at X", "Led Y", "10 years in Z")

**Social proof**: logos of notable clients or past employers, media mentions, certifications

---

### 4. Services Page Messaging Map

This page converts buyers who've moved past awareness. Write the marketing copy — what to say on the page, verbatim.

**Services overview**: one headline framing the suite around the customer's transformation, plus 2-3 sentences describing the overall approach.

**For each tier** (reference the Pricing doc for tier names and structure — do not re-describe what's in the Pricing doc here):
- **Who it's for**: specific sub-segment of ICP
- **The promise**: outcome, stated as transformation
- **CTA**: specific to this tier (e.g., "Book a Foundation Call", "See if Growth is right for you")

**Process / methodology section**: how the business delivers, written as 3-5 steps with a brief description of each.

For the add-ons, write one sentence: "Additional services are available — see the [Pricing doc link] for the full list."

---

### 5. Contact / Conversion Page Messaging Map

- **Headline**: acknowledge what they're about to do — make it feel easy and worthwhile
- **Subheadline**: set expectations ("Here's what happens next")
- **What to expect**: after submitting — timeline, format, outcome of the call
- **Form fields**: minimal — name, email, company size, "What's your biggest challenge right now?"
- **Reassurance**: what makes this safe to do (no hard sell, specific next step, easy to opt out)

---

## CTA Hierarchy

Every page should have a clear hierarchy:
1. **Primary CTA**: the one action the site is optimized for
2. **Secondary CTA**: lower-commitment alternative
3. **Exit CTA**: catch visitors before they leave (newsletter or resource offer)

Avoid more than 2 CTAs competing on a single page section.

## Success Criteria

The Website Messaging Map is complete when:
- [ ] A visitor can understand the value proposition in under 5 seconds on the homepage
- [ ] Every page has a single primary CTA with a clear hierarchy
- [ ] The problem section uses language directly from the ICP doc's pain points
- [ ] The services page contains marketing copy — it does not re-describe tier structure from the Pricing doc
- [ ] Headlines use specific numbers, outcomes, or customer descriptions — not generic claims
- [ ] The messaging is consistent with the Brand Voice doc throughout
- [ ] A developer could build all key pages from this document without asking questions
