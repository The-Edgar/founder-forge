# Website Messaging Map — Artifact Guide

## Purpose

The Website Messaging Map is the translation layer between strategy and execution. It takes everything built so far — the ICP, positioning, brand voice, and pricing — and turns it into specific copy frameworks for each page of the website.

This isn't a wireframe. It's a messaging architecture: what to say, in what order, with what goal, on every key page. A designer or developer can build directly from this document.

---

## Document Structure

### 1. Messaging Strategy Overview

A brief (1-2 paragraph) summary of the website's core job:
- What is the primary goal of the website? (Generate leads, build credibility, drive demo bookings, sell directly?)
- What stage of the buying journey does the website primarily serve? (Awareness, consideration, decision?)
- What does the ideal visitor experience look like? (First visit → What action do we want them to take?)

**Primary CTA** (the one action the entire site funnels toward):
- CTA label: (e.g., "Book a Strategy Call", "Start Free Trial", "Download the Guide")
- CTA destination: (e.g., Calendly link, signup page, lead magnet)
- Why this CTA for this ICP: (connects to buying behavior from ICP artifact)

---

### 2. Homepage Messaging Map

The homepage is the most critical page. It must answer 3 questions in the first 5 seconds:
1. What is this?
2. Who is it for?
3. Why should I care?

#### Hero Section

**Headline**: (8-12 words, the clearest possible statement of the primary benefit for the ICP)
- Formula options:
  - **Benefit-first**: "[Specific Outcome] for [Specific Customer]"
  - **Problem-first**: "Stop [Specific Frustration]. Start [Specific Outcome]."
  - **Only we**: "The only [category] that [unique differentiator] for [customer]"

Provide 3 headline options to choose from.

**Subheadline**: (1-2 sentences that add specificity — who it's for, how it works, what makes it different)
- Should answer "how?" or "what specifically?"
- 20-30 words maximum

**Hero CTA**: Primary button label + supporting secondary CTA if applicable
- Primary: [Label] — (action-oriented, specific)
- Secondary: [Label] — (lower commitment option, e.g., "See how it works")

**Hero visual/proof note**: What should sit next to or below the hero copy? (e.g., client logos, a result stat, a product screenshot, a photo of the team)

---

#### Problem Statement Section

Articulate the problem the ICP faces before introducing the solution. This is where buyers feel seen.

**Section headline**: (frames the problem without sounding negative)
**Body**: 2-4 bullet points or short paragraphs describing:
- The situation the ICP is in
- The frustrations they're experiencing
- The cost of the status quo (time, money, missed opportunity)

Use language pulled directly from the ICP artifact's pain points section.

---

#### Solution Overview Section

The bridge from problem to solution.

**Section headline**: (introduces the solution category and primary benefit)
**Body**: 2-3 short paragraphs or bullet points describing:
- What this solution does (high level)
- How it works (the mechanism, briefly)
- The transformation: before → after

**Supporting visual**: What would reinforce this section? (process graphic, before/after, diagram?)

---

#### Key Benefits / How It Works Section

Depending on the business, this is either a "benefits" section (for service businesses) or a "how it works" section (for products or structured processes).

Provide 3-4 benefits or steps. For each:
- **Icon or label**: (one-word or short descriptor)
- **Headline**: (the benefit or step, in 5-8 words)
- **Body**: (1-3 sentences of supporting detail)

---

#### Social Proof Section

Credibility anchors. Format depends on available proof:

**If testimonials exist:**
- Feature 2-3 testimonials pulled from the ICP's peer group
- Format: Quote + Name + Title/Company + Photo (if available)
- Arrange by stage of buying journey (awareness testimonial, consideration testimonial, results testimonial)

**If case studies exist:**
- Headline: "[Client type] achieved [specific result] in [timeframe]"
- 2-3 sentence summary of the outcome
- Link to full case study

**If no testimonials yet:**
- Feature specific outcome claims backed by the founder's credentials
- Early adopter language: "Built for [ICP description]"
- Credibility signals: notable past employers, certifications, partnerships

---

#### Final CTA Section

Repeat the primary CTA with more urgency or conviction at the bottom of the page.

**Section headline**: (addresses the final objection before they leave — often about risk or timing)
**Body**: 1-2 sentences that reduce friction or increase urgency
**CTA button**: Same as hero, or a slightly different angle

---

### 3. About Page Messaging Map

The About page is a trust page — buyers come here to decide if they like and trust the people behind the product.

**Origin story** (2-4 paragraphs):
- Why this business exists (the founder's genuine motivation)
- The problem they personally experienced or witnessed
- The moment they decided to build this solution
- What makes them the right people to build it

**Team section**: (for each key team member)
- Name, title, 2-3 sentence bio
- Specific credibility: "Previously at X", "Led Y", "10 years in Z"
- Optional: 1 humanizing detail

**Mission / values section**: (optional, but effective for businesses where trust matters)
- 1-sentence mission statement
- 2-4 values with brief explanation

**Social proof on About**: Logos of notable clients or past employers, media mentions, certifications

---

### 4. Services Page Messaging Map

This is the conversion page for buyers who've moved past awareness.

**Services overview section**:
- Headline: framing the suite of offerings around the customer's transformation, not around features
- 2-3 sentence description of the overall approach

**Individual service / tier sections** (one per offering from the Pricing artifact):

For each tier:
- **Service name**: (from Pricing artifact)
- **Who it's for**: (specific sub-segment of ICP)
- **The promise**: (outcome, stated as transformation)
- **What's included**: (specific list)
- **Price or "starting at"**: (from Pricing artifact guidance)
- **CTA**: specific to this service (e.g., "Book a Foundation Call", "See if Growth is right for you")

**Process / methodology section**:
- How the business delivers
- 3-5 steps with a brief description of each
- Conveys professionalism and sets expectations

---

### 5. Contact / Conversion Page Messaging Map

The last page before a lead becomes a conversation.

**Headline**: (acknowledge what they're about to do — make it feel easy and worthwhile)
**Subheadline**: (set expectations — "Here's what happens next")
**What to expect**: (after submitting: timeline, format, outcome of the call)
**Form fields**: (minimal — name, email, company size, "What's your biggest challenge right now?")
**Reassurance**: (below the form — what makes this safe to do)

---

## Headline Frameworks

Reference these frameworks when writing section headlines:

| Framework | Formula | Best For |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| Benefit-first | "[Action] your [outcome]" | Hero, CTAs |
| Problem-agitate | "Still [frustrating situation]?" | Problem section |
| Social proof | "[X customers] [achieved Y] using [product]" | Social proof sections |
| Specificity | "In [timeframe], [outcome] — guaranteed" | CTA section |
| Transformation | "From [before state] to [after state]" | Services, About |
| Authority | "The [category] trusted by [credibility signal]" | About, Header |

---

## CTA Hierarchy

Every page should have a clear CTA hierarchy:

1. **Primary CTA**: The one action the site is optimized for (e.g., "Book a Strategy Call")
2. **Secondary CTA**: Lower-commitment alternative (e.g., "Download the Guide", "See case studies")
3. **Exit CTA**: Catch visitors before they leave (newsletter, chatbot, or resource offer)

Avoid having more than 2 CTAs competing on a single page section.

---
