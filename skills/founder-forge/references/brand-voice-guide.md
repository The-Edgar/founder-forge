# Brand Voice & Messaging Framework — Artifact Guide

## Purpose

Brand voice is the consistent personality that shows up in every word a company writes or says. It's what makes a reader think "that sounds like them" — or "that's off." Done right, brand voice builds trust through repetition and makes communication feel human, not corporate.

This artifact defines the voice system: the personality attributes, tone guidelines, and vocabulary rules that ensure every piece of communication sounds like one coherent brand. Channel-specific execution (what to post, what to say, how to write hooks) belongs in the GTM Playbook — not here.

## Document Structure

### 1. Sample Messaging in Brand Voice

Put this section first — it's the most immediately useful part of the document.

Write **3 short copy samples** showing the brand voice in action. For each, show:
- **Context**: (what this would be used for — e.g., homepage headline, cold email opening line, LinkedIn post opener)
- **In-voice version**: (the brand-appropriate copy)
- **Out-of-voice comparison**: (what it sounds like in generic corporate-speak)

Use contexts that are immediately applicable: homepage hero, cold email opener, and one social post opener.

### 2. Brand Personality Portrait

A short narrative (100-150 words) describing the brand's personality as if it were a person:
- If this brand were a person at a dinner party, how would they come across?
- What would they talk about? How would they engage?
- What would they never do or say?

Make the personality feel vivid and real — not a list of adjectives.

**Example structure (adapt to the specific business):**
> "[Brand] is the person in the room who's clearly done the work. They don't need to tell you how smart they are — it comes through in how they talk. They're direct without being harsh, confident without being arrogant. They use specific examples, not vague concepts. They'd rather lose a client than overpromise."

---

### 3. Voice Attributes

Define **3-4 core voice attributes** — the personality traits that define the brand. For each:

**[Attribute Name]** — (one-word label: Direct, Warm, Sharp, Grounded, etc.)

- **What this means in practice**: 1-2 sentences
- ✓ **Do this**: one example
- ✗ **Not this**: the wrong version

Add a 3-bullet note on tone drift — the common situations where this brand's voice tends to slip, and how to stay on-brand. This note is attached to the Voice Attributes section, not written as a separate section.

Example drift note format:
- *In proposals*: resist getting overly formal — keep sentences short and use "you/we" language
- *Sharing wins*: be specific about the result, let numbers speak rather than overclaiming
- *Cold outreach*: lead with value, not with "I"

---

### 4. Tone Spectrum

Write one master tone description: where this brand sits on the formal/casual and serious/playful axes, and how technical vs. accessible the language runs by default.

Follow with a 2-3 item exceptions note: "More formal in proposals. More playful in social content. Never technical in outbound email." That's enough.

Do not write per-channel tone guidance — channel execution belongs in the GTM Playbook.

---

### 5. Vocabulary Guide

One table with two columns: **Use** and **Avoid**. Max 8 rows each.

Include the top 3 industry clichés in the Avoid column — the terms everyone in this industry overuses that feel hollow. Do not write a separate clichés section.

| Use | Avoid |
|-----|-------|
| [Word or phrase] | [Word or phrase + why] |

---

### 6. Sentence & Structure Style

Five direct statements — no sub-headers:

1. **Sentence length**: target word count for marketing copy sentences
2. **Paragraph length**: max sentence count per paragraph in marketing content
3. **Questions**: does this brand use rhetorical questions, or prefer declarative statements?
4. **Numbers**: preference for specific numbers over vague claims (always, selectively, rarely)
5. **Voice**: first/second person defaults — "we" or "I"? "you" or the customer category name?

## Success Criteria

The Brand Voice artifact is complete when:
- [ ] Sample Messaging appears first and contains 3 usable copy examples
- [ ] The personality portrait makes someone say "I can picture this brand"
- [ ] Each voice attribute has a "this, not that" contrast that makes the guardrail clear
- [ ] Tone drift guidance is a 3-bullet note, not a standalone section
- [ ] The vocabulary table includes actual words — not just categories
- [ ] No channel-specific do's/don'ts (that belongs in the GTM Playbook)
- [ ] A new team member could use this to write on-brand content without asking questions
