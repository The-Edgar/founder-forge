# Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) — Artifact Guide

## Purpose

The ICP is the foundation of everything else. Get this wrong and the positioning, messaging, pricing, and GTM strategy all drift. Get it right and every subsequent artifact clicks into place with precision.

A great ICP is specific enough that you could open LinkedIn, type a search, and find the exact person described. It's not a demographic range — it's a portrait.

---

## Document Structure

The ICP artifact should contain these sections in order:

### 1. Profile Overview

One-paragraph portrait of the ideal customer. Write it as if describing a specific person (even if they're a composite). Include enough detail that a sales or marketing person could picture them clearly.

**For B2B:**
- Job title and seniority
- Company size and stage
- Industry
- What they're responsible for
- What keeps them up at night professionally

**For B2C:**
- Age range and life stage
- Income and spending habits
- Key lifestyle markers
- What they care about most
- What they're trying to become or achieve

---

### 2. Demographics & Firmographics

**B2B firmographics:**
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Company size | e.g., 50-200 employees |
| Revenue range | e.g., $5M-$30M ARR |
| Industry | e.g., B2B SaaS, Professional Services |
| Geography | e.g., US, English-speaking markets |
| Company stage | e.g., Series A-B, bootstrapped |
| Tech stack sophistication | e.g., Modern SaaS-forward stack |
| Funding status | e.g., VC-backed |

**B2C demographics:**
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Age range | |
| Gender distribution | |
| Income range | |
| Education | |
| Location | |
| Life stage | |

### 3. Psychographics

What does this person believe? What do they value? What motivates them beyond their functional job?

- **Core values**: (e.g., efficiency over tradition, data-driven decisions, results over process)
- **Professional identity**: How do they see themselves and their role?
- **Aspirations**: Where do they want to be in 2-3 years?
- **Peer group**: Who do they follow, learn from, or compare themselves to?
- **Content they consume**: Publications, podcasts, communities, influencers

---

### 4. Pain Points & Challenges

The 3-5 most significant problems they face that your business directly addresses. Be specific — use language they'd actually use.

For each pain point:
- **The problem**: (what's broken or missing)
- **The impact**: (what it costs them — time, money, opportunity, stress)
- **Current workaround**: (what they do about it today, imperfectly)

**Example (not to copy — adapt to the specific business):**
> **Pain point**: Can't find reliable contractors for overflow work
> **Impact**: Projects get delayed, existing team burns out, revenue opportunity is lost
> **Workaround**: Posting on Upwork, spending 5+ hours reviewing applications per project

---

### 5. Buying Triggers

What has to happen for this person to start looking for a solution? Triggers are the specific events or conditions that move them from "not looking" to "actively searching."

- **Positive triggers**: (growth event, new hire, new initiative, budget opening up)
- **Pain triggers**: (failed project, lost client, team departure, cost overrun)
- **External triggers**: (competitor move, industry change, compliance requirement)
- **Timing triggers**: (fiscal year end, planning cycle, contract renewal)

---

### 6. Decision-Making Process

How do they actually buy?

- **Who initiates the search?** (champion vs. decision-maker vs. end user)
- **How many people are involved?** (solo vs. committee)
- **Typical decision timeline**: (days, weeks, months?)
- **Key evaluation criteria**: (What do they compare? What must a vendor have?)
- **Where do they find vendors?** (Google, referrals, communities, LinkedIn, etc.)
- **What kills a deal?** (Red flags, objections, must-haves that disqualify)

---

### 7. Objections & Concerns

The top 3-5 objections this buyer raises before committing. For each:
- **The objection**: (what they say or think)
- **The real concern behind it**: (what they actually fear)
- **The response**: (how to address it)

Common objection categories:
- Price / ROI uncertainty
- Risk of switching / implementation burden
- "Not the right time" / prioritization
- Trust / credibility concerns about a newer provider
- Internal resource constraints

---

### 8. Communication Preferences

How and where to reach them:
- **Preferred channels**: (email, LinkedIn, community, referral, events)
- **Content that resonates**: (case studies, data reports, thought leadership, demos, peer recommendations)
- **Tone sensitivity**: (formal/professional vs. conversational/direct)
- **When they engage**: (morning email scanner, afternoon social browser, etc.)

---

### 9. Day-in-the-Life Scenario

A short narrative (150-200 words) describing a typical day or week for this person. Paint the picture of their professional life — the meetings they're in, the tools they're using, the decisions they're making, the frustrations they're navigating.

This is the most humanizing section of the ICP. It makes subsequent artifact work (especially messaging and GTM) feel concrete rather than abstract.

---

## Making ICPs Specific: The Specificity Test

**Weak ICP:** "Our customer is a small business owner who wants to grow their business and improve their marketing."

**Strong ICP:** "Our customer is the founder-led CEO of a 2-10 person creative agency (design, branding, or marketing) doing $500K-$2M in revenue. They're spending 15+ hours/week on new business development but losing deals to larger shops with more polished proposals. They value craft over hustle culture and are skeptical of aggressive sales tactics."

Run every ICP through these tests:
1. **The LinkedIn test**: Could you find this person with a LinkedIn search? If not, it's too vague.
2. **The exclusion test**: Does your ICP explicitly exclude some people? If not, it's too broad.
3. **The "so what?" test**: After each trait, ask "so what does that mean for how we market/sell?" If you can't answer, the trait doesn't belong.
4. **The recognition test**: Would your best existing customer read this and say "that's me"?

## Red Flags in a Weak ICP

- "Anyone who needs [your service]" — too broad
- Only demographic descriptors, no psychographics or behavior
- No specific pain points — just category of problem
- Buying triggers missing — no understanding of when they search
- No mention of how they discover vendors or evaluate options
- Sounds like it was written to make the founder feel good, not to guide sales/marketing

## Success Criteria

The ICP artifact is complete when:
- [ ] You could identify 10 real people who match it using LinkedIn or a database
- [ ] A salesperson could use it to qualify a prospect in under 5 minutes
- [ ] The pain points use language the customer would actually use (not corporate-speak)
- [ ] The buying trigger section explains WHY someone would search RIGHT NOW
- [ ] The objections section gives real, usable responses to real concerns
- [ ] The day-in-the-life makes the target feel like a real human, not a demographic
