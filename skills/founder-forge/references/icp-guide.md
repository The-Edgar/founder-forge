# Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) — Artifact Guide

## Purpose

The ICP is the foundation of everything else. Get this wrong and the positioning, messaging, pricing, and GTM strategy all drift. Get it right and every subsequent artifact clicks into place with precision.

A great ICP is specific enough that you could open LinkedIn, type a search, and find the exact person described. It's not a demographic range — it's a portrait.

## Document Structure

### 1. Profile Overview

One-paragraph portrait of the ideal customer. Write it as if describing a specific person (even if they're a composite). Include enough detail that a sales or marketing person could picture them clearly.

**For B2B:**
- Job title and seniority
- Company size and stage
- Industry
- What they're responsible for
- What keeps them up at night professionally

**For B2C:**
- Age range and life stage
- Income and spending habits
- Key lifestyle markers
- What they care about most
- What they're trying to become or achieve

---

### 2. Demographics & Firmographics

**B2B firmographics:**
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Company size | e.g., 50-200 employees |
| Revenue range | e.g., $5M-$30M ARR |
| Industry | e.g., B2B SaaS, Professional Services |
| Geography | e.g., US, English-speaking markets |
| Company stage | e.g., Series A-B, bootstrapped |
| Tech stack sophistication | e.g., Modern SaaS-forward stack |
| Funding status | e.g., VC-backed |

**B2C demographics:**
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Age range | |
| Gender distribution | |
| Income range | |
| Education | |
| Location | |
| Life stage | |

### 3. Psychographics

What does this person believe? What do they value? What motivates them beyond their functional job?

- **Core values**: (e.g., efficiency over tradition, data-driven decisions, results over process)
- **Professional identity**: How do they see themselves and their role?
- **Aspirations**: Where do they want to be in 2-3 years?
- **Peer group**: Who do they follow, learn from, or compare themselves to?
- **Content they consume**: Publications, podcasts, communities, influencers

---

### 4. Pain Points & Challenges

The 3-5 most significant problems they face that this business directly addresses. Use language the customer would actually use — not corporate-speak.

For each pain point, write three items on one line:
- **The problem** | **The impact** (what it costs them — time, money, opportunity, stress) | **Current workaround** (what they do today, imperfectly)

---

### 5. Buying Triggers

What has to happen for this person to start looking for a solution? List triggers in 4 categories, 1-2 bullets each:

- **Positive triggers**: (growth event, new hire, new initiative, budget opening up)
- **Pain triggers**: (failed project, lost client, team departure, cost overrun)
- **External triggers**: (competitor move, industry change, compliance requirement)
- **Timing triggers**: (fiscal year end, planning cycle, contract renewal)

---

### 6. Decision-Making Process

Write as 3 direct statements — no sub-headers:

1. **Who decides**: Name who initiates the search, who evaluates options, and who signs off. If it's a committee, name the roles.
2. **Timeline**: Typical time from first search to signed contract.
3. **Top 2 evaluation criteria**: The two factors that most determine which vendor wins.

Do not include an Approval Chain breakdown. Do not list every factor they consider. State who, how long, and what matters most — that's enough.

---

### 7. Objections & Concerns

The top 3-5 objections this buyer raises before committing. Write each as a single row:

**Objection** → **Real concern behind it** → **One-sentence counter**

Full objection response strategy and pricing objection handling belong in the Pricing doc, not here.

---

### 8. Communication Preferences

Write exactly 3 bullets:
- Where they spend attention (channels they actually use)
- What content format earns their trust
- Tone they respond to (formal/professional vs. conversational/direct)

---

### 9. Day-in-the-Life

Write 5-6 sentences describing a typical day or week for this person. Cover the meetings they're in, the tools they're using, the decisions they're making, and one specific frustration they feel. The goal is to make the target feel like a real human, not a demographic.

Do not write a narrative longer than 6 sentences. This is a snapshot, not a short story.

---

## Making ICPs Specific: The Specificity Test

**Weak ICP:** "Our customer is a small business owner who wants to grow their business and improve their marketing."

**Strong ICP:** "Our customer is the founder-led CEO of a 2-10 person creative agency (design, branding, or marketing) doing $500K-$2M in revenue. They're spending 15+ hours/week on new business development but losing deals to larger shops with more polished proposals. They value craft over hustle culture and are skeptical of aggressive sales tactics."

Run every ICP through these tests:
1. **The LinkedIn test**: Could you find this person with a LinkedIn search? If not, it's too vague.
2. **The exclusion test**: Does your ICP explicitly exclude some people? If not, it's too broad.
3. **The recognition test**: Would your best existing customer read this and say "that's me"?

## Success Criteria

The ICP artifact is complete when:
- [ ] You could identify 10 real people who match it using LinkedIn or a database
- [ ] A salesperson could use it to qualify a prospect in under 5 minutes
- [ ] The pain points use language the customer would actually use
- [ ] The buying trigger section explains WHY someone would search RIGHT NOW
- [ ] The Day-in-the-Life is 5-6 sentences and feels like a real person
- [ ] Each objection has a one-sentence counter
